# Semi-Supervised-Federated-Learning-for-Network-Intrusion-Detection

This repo demonstrates the code for the paper "Attention-based Interpretable Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Network Intrusion Detection" (not published yet).

You can download the data from the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F189Nyu-sMTcZaXOX47_yQsRGkTOGwK1?usp=share_link

To run the code, you just run the file `train_tabnet_FL.py`. 

We also provide the code implementation to compared with other method in folder `experiment_other_papers`.
